## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

**If Big Blue Button Doesn't Work:**
- Check console for: `🧪 BIG TEST BUTTON TAPPED!`
- If no console message = button not responding
- If console message but no picker = sheet presentation issue

**If Color Squares Don't Work:**
- Check console for: `🎨 Color square tapped: #XXXXXX`
- If no console message = tap not detected
- If console message but no picker = same as above

**If Nothing Opens Edit Properties:**
- Make sure you tapped "Edit" button at bottom of main screen
- Should see navigation title "Edit Properties"

## 📋 **EXPECTED CONSOLE OUTPUT**

When everything works, you should see:
```
🧪 BIG TEST BUTTON TAPPED!
🧪 Should open color picker now...
🎨 Color selected: #0000FF → #FF0000
🎨 Before - colorReplacements count: 0  
🎨 After - colorReplacements count: 1
